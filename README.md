# landing-page

This was the first big project assignment from The Odin Project.

I honestly had no idea how to start, so I searched the completed examples and looked at other people's code as a template for what I was trying to achieve.

The biggest challenge was flexbox and moving divs, but once I saw how divs could be encapsulated in other divs it made a lot more sense.

This exercise mainly got me familiar with Flexbox and how to research CSS.
